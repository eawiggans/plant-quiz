# Plant Quiz Project


## Description

This is a multiple choice, 5-question, timed quiz. The user races the clock, and has time taken off the clock for incorrect answers. For the developer the quiz was an exercise in web API's, and hopefully it is fun for the user as well.

## Usage

To play, click start and then click the button on which your answer choice is displayed. Input initials when prompted.
